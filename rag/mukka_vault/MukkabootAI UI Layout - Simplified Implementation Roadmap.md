# MukkabootAI UI Layout - Simplified Implementation Roadmap

## Service Registration Verification
✅ **Verified**: All services are now properly registering with the Base Service:
- Base Service is running on port 3010
- Auth Service is registered and running on port 3013
- Memory Service is registered and running on port 3011
- Filesystem Service is registered and running on port 3012
- Brave Search Service is registered and running on port 3014
- Ollama Bridge Service is registered and running on port 3015

## Revised Minimal Implementation Plan

### 1. Core User Experience Features (Priority)
- [ ] Ensure smooth landing page and login experience
  - [ ] Add a loading spinner during the login process to improve user feedback
- [ ] Verify dashboard is displaying real service status
  - [ ] Ensure service status updates in real-time without page refresh
- [ ] Make sure agent selection and chat functionality works correctly
- [ ] Test basic user flows: login → dashboard → select agent → chat

### 2. Three-Panel Chat Interface (Critical)
- [ ] Verify left sidebar collapses properly on mobile devices
  - [ ] Implement an accessible hamburger icon with proper ARIA labels for mobile toggle
- [ ] Test chat message pagination and loading on slow connections
  - [ ] Add simple loading indicators for message pagination
- [ ] Ensure conversation history persists correctly
- [ ] Fix any WebSocket disconnection issues for real-time updates

### 3. Agents Page Core Functionality (Essential)
- [ ] Ensure My Agents tab displays user's available agents
  - [ ] Implement basic text filtering for the agent list
- [ ] Verify agent selection redirects to chat with correct context
- [ ] Test basic agent filtering functionality 
- [ ] Ensure Agent Wizard can create functional basic agents

### 4. Basic Accessibility (Compliance)
- [ ] Verify keyboard navigation for critical paths
- [ ] Test with screen reader on main user flows
- [ ] Ensure color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
- [ ] Add skip links for keyboard users

### 5. Essential Performance Improvements
- [ ] Implement basic lazy-loading for non-critical components
- [ ] Add error boundaries around key functional areas
- [ ] Optimize initial page load for dashboard
- [ ] Implement basic offline fallbacks for critical screens

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Focus on Core Functionality First**:
   - Prioritize making critical user flows work reliably
   - Defer enhanced features until core functionality is solid

2. **Incremental Testing Approach**:
   - Test each core feature immediately after updates
   - Create basic user flow tests for critical paths
   - Document any workarounds needed for production use

3. **Essential Error Handling**:
   - Add basic error recovery for chat functionality
   - Implement simple loading states for asynchronous operations
   - Create user-friendly error messages for common failures

4. **Modular File Structure**:
   - Break larger components (>200 lines) into logical sub-components
   - Create clear import/export patterns for reassembly
   - Keep related functionality in the same directory

5. **Documentation Focus**:
   - Document core user flows with screenshots
   - Create simple troubleshooting guides for common issues
   - Maintain a known issues list with workarounds

## Technical Recommendations

1. **Reduce WebSocket Dependencies**:
   - Consider fallback to polling for non-critical real-time updates
   - Implement reconnection logic for WebSocket disruptions

2. **Simplify State Management**:
   - Focus on essential Pinia stores (auth, agents, chat)
   - Defer complex state patterns until core functionality is stable

3. **Responsive Design Priorities**:
   - Ensure the application is usable on mobile devices
   - Focus on critical breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - Defer complex responsive animations

4. **Authentication Robustness**:
   - Ensure proper token refresh mechanisms
   - Implement graceful session timeout handling
   - Add clear login state indicators

This simplified approach focuses on getting a working, reliable system with essential features rather than implementing all enhancements simultaneously. It prioritizes user experience on the critical paths and ensures that fundamental functionality works correctly before adding more complex features.
